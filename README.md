## Project Overview

üîµ Delighted to unveil my **C++ Filehandling Project - SmartKiosk System**! This project replicates the concept of a smart kiosk system, which I previously developed using HTML and JavaScript, but now implemented using **C++ and File Handling**.

This project has been a great opportunity for me to explore **file handling** and **robust data management** in C++, and it has significantly improved my programming skills. I received the highest marks in the entire **BCA 2nd Year** for this project!
